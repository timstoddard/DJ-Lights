DJ Lights program

This is the first version of a DJ Lights program I have been working on. There are currently 4 visual modes (Beams, Madness, Spinner, Strobe), as well as 2 mode switching options (Cycle and Random). The next feature that I am going to add is the ability to sync the visuals with music input from a microphone (built-in or otherwise).

There is currently a bug where the dropdown menu to switch between visual modes does not work in fullscreen. This is seemingly due to the behavior of the java fullscreen API.
