# DJ-Lights
DJ Lights program

This is the first version of a DJ Lights program I have been working on. There are currently 5 visual modes (Beams, Dots, Madness, Spinner, Strobe), as well as 2 mode switching options (Cycle and Random). The next feature that I am going to add is the ability to sync the visuals with music input from a microphone (built-in or otherwise).

There is currently a bug where the dropdown menus in the control panel do not work in fullscreen. This is seemingly due to the behavior of the java fullscreen API. The best workaround I have found is to set all desired settings in windowed mode, then enter fullscreen and enjoy the show.
